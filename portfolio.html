        <p>I've seen the sun set in Barcelona. Once, I stumbled out a bar, only to gaze upon the Colosseum in Rome. A song has been written about me. I've been in love, and been, to quote Hank Williams, "So Lonesome I Could Cry". I've bungee jumped, talked in front of 15,000 people, won an award for my butt, and witnessed some of the finest moments in Minnesota sports history. Despite all of the that, I still don't really know what's going on. I probably never will totally know what exactly is going on, but I'll have some fun as I try to discover it.</p>
